# Diaper Defense üçºüí©

A hilarious arcade-style game built for Reddit using Three.js and Devvit. Control a diaper to catch falling poop projectiles while avoiding the dangerous black "bomb poop" that ends your game instantly! Features a complete high score system with leaderboards and automatic score saving.

## What is Diaper Defense?

**Diaper Defense is a fully playable, production-ready arcade game** that runs directly within Reddit posts using Three.js and the Devvit platform. This absurdly entertaining game puts you in control of a white diaper at the bottom of the screen, tasked with catching falling poop projectiles while making strategic decisions about which ones to catch and which to avoid.

**This is a complete, fully-functional game with sophisticated mechanics** - not a demo or prototype. Every system is implemented and polished, from the advanced particle effects and procedural audio to the cross-platform input handling, performance optimization systems, and comprehensive high score tracking with persistent leaderboards.

The game features an expressive baby at the top of the screen who oscillates left and right, shooting three different types of poop downward: brown regular poop (10 points), golden fancy poop (50 points), and dangerous black bomb poop that instantly ends your game. Your goal is to move the diaper left and right to catch the valuable poop while strategically avoiding or letting the bomb poop fall past you. All scores are automatically saved to a persistent high score system with interactive leaderboards.

**NEW: 5-Second Grace Period** - The baby now waits 5 seconds before shooting the first poop, giving players even more time to get familiar with the controls and prepare for the action!

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Baby Shoots Poop**: An expressive baby at the top oscillates left and right, shooting three types of poop projectiles downward at increasing speeds (after a 3-second initial delay)
2. **Strategic Catching**: You control the diaper using arrow keys (desktop) or touch controls (mobile) to catch valuable poop while avoiding dangerous ones
3. **Risk-Reward Decisions**: Regular brown poop gives 10 points, fancy golden poop gives 50 points, but black bomb poop instantly ends your game
4. **Smart Miss System**: Missing regular/fancy poop counts against you (game over after 2 consecutive misses), but missing bomb poop actually helps by resetting your miss counter
5. **Progressive Challenge**: Every 15 seconds, the baby shoots faster and fancy poop becomes more common, creating an escalating difficulty curve

### What Makes It Special

This isn't just another casual game - it's a sophisticated arcade experience with **dynamic baby emotions** (crying for regular/black bomb poop, happy for golden poop), **advanced particle effects** for every action, **procedural audio generation**, and **cross-platform controls** optimized for both desktop and mobile play. The game features **object pooling** for performance, **error handling** with graceful fallbacks, and a **complete UI system** with animated transitions between splash screen, gameplay, and game over states.

**Key Innovation: The Revolutionary Miss System** - Unlike traditional games where missing anything is bad, Diaper Defense introduces strategic depth where missing the dangerous black bomb poop is actually GOOD because it resets your consecutive miss counter. Only missing the valuable brown and golden poop counts against you, creating intense split-second decisions about whether to risk going for high-value targets or play it safe.

The result is an addictive, strategic arcade game that perfectly captures Reddit's playful spirit while delivering genuinely engaging gameplay mechanics and smooth 60 FPS performance.
