## How to Play

### Game Objective
Catch as many falling poop projectiles as possible with your diaper while avoiding the pink "boob poop" that will instantly end your game. Survive the increasingly challenging waves and rack up the highest score possible!

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Starting the Game**
   - Click the animated "Play Now" button on the splash screen to begin
   - The splash screen features an engaging title "Diaper Defense" with subtitle "The Ultimate Baby Poop Catching Game!"
   - Feature badges highlight "üçº Arcade Action", "üì± Mobile Friendly", and "üèÜ High Scores"
   - The game smoothly transitions to full gameplay mode with the HUD visible at the top
   - You'll see your diaper (white rectangle) at the bottom and the baby (light pink square) oscillating at the top
   - The sky blue background (#87CEEB) and brown ground line create the game arena

2. **Mastering the Controls**
   - **Desktop Controls**: Use the left (‚Üê) and right (‚Üí) arrow keys to move your diaper horizontally
     - Exponential smoothing interpolation provides natural, responsive movement with 8.0 smoothing factor
     - Enhanced boundary validation prevents the diaper from moving outside the play area
     - Keys are optimized with proper focus management and prevent unwanted page scrolling
     - Movement speed automatically adapts to diaper speed (15% per key press) for optimal control precision
     - Maximum speed limit prevents overshooting during rapid movement
   - **Mobile Controls**: Touch and drag left or right anywhere on the screen to move your diaper
     - Advanced touch handling with 15-pixel dead zone prevents accidental movements
     - Sensitivity scaling (1.5x multiplier) ensures responsive touch control
     - Input validation prevents invalid movements outside canvas bounds
     - Smooth absolute positioning maps touch coordinates to world coordinates for precise control
     - Touch input takes priority when both keyboard and touch are active
   - The diaper moves with buttery-smooth exponential smoothing and includes enhanced bobbing animation with multiple wave components for visual appeal

3. **Understanding the Poop Arsenal**
   - **Brown Poop (Regular)**: Worth 10 points each - starts at 70% spawn probability
     - The bread and butter of your score - safe to catch and reliable points
     - Brown color (#8B4513) makes them easy to identify
     - Creates standard sparkle and score pop particle effects when caught
   - **Golden Poop (Fancy)**: Worth 50 points each - starts at 25% probability, increases by 5% every 100 points you score
     - High-value targets that become more common as you improve
     - Shimmering gold color (#FFD700) makes them stand out
     - Creates spectacular particle effects with multiple sparkle bursts and delayed celebration effects
     - Risk vs reward: worth going for, but don't compromise your safety
   - **Pink Poop (Boob)**: Instant game over - constant 5% spawn probability throughout the game
     - Hot pink color (#FF69B4) serves as a danger warning
     - Avoid at all costs - catching one immediately ends your game regardless of your miss count
     - Creates ominous splash effects and warning particles before triggering game over
   - All poop projectiles fall at slightly randomized speeds (¬±25 unit variation) with rotation animation for visual variety

4. **Advanced Game Mechanics**
   - **Baby Behavior**: The baby oscillates horizontally using smooth sine wave motion across the top of the screen
     - Oscillation amplitude of 150 units with speed of 2 units creates predictable but dynamic movement
     - Baby shoots poop at random intervals starting at 2000ms, with ¬±50% variation (1000-3000ms range)
     - Enhanced shooting animation with 4 phases: anticipation (scale down), burst (scale up + crying), intense shake with rotation, and recovery bounce-back
   - **Progressive Difficulty**: Every 15 seconds, the shooting interval decreases by 10% (minimum 500ms for maximum challenge)
     - This creates a natural difficulty curve that rewards survival and skill development
     - Advanced players will face rapid-fire poop barrages in later stages
   - **Enhanced Visual Feedback System**: 
     - Baby plays multi-phase shooting animations with anticipation, crying effects, variable intensity shaking, and rotation
     - Diaper responds with simplified catch animations (brief scale and brightness flash) and miss animations (red flash feedback)
     - Particle effects provide immediate feedback with different patterns: sparkles for catches, splashes for misses, puffs for shooting
   - **Miss Tracking System**: You can miss up to 2 poop projectiles before the game ends
     - Consecutive misses are tracked separately from total misses for strategic gameplay
     - Successfully catching any poop resets your consecutive miss counter
     - HUD displays both total misses and consecutive misses: "Misses: X (Y consecutive)"
   - **Real-time HUD**: Score and detailed miss information are displayed live in the top corners with smooth animations
   - **Precision Collision Detection**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection ensures fair and responsive gameplay

5. **Game Over Conditions & Recovery**
   - **Instant Death Scenario**: Catch a pink boob poop (immediate game over regardless of your current miss count)
     - Creates dramatic particle effects with multiple splash bursts
   - **Miss Limit Scenario**: Miss 2 poop projectiles consecutively (they fall off the bottom of the screen)
     - Enhanced miss effects with different particle patterns based on poop type
   - **Game Over Experience**: Smooth transition to game over screen with brown semi-transparent background
     - Shows final score with "Game Over!" title in light pink and "Play Again" button
     - Includes shake animation effects for dramatic game over presentation
   - **Quick Restart**: The restart system preserves your momentum - click "Play Again" to immediately jump back into action

6. **Pro Strategy Guide**
   - **Optimal Positioning**: Stay centered under the baby's oscillation path for maximum coverage area
     - The baby's sine wave motion is predictable - learn the pattern to anticipate poop trajectories
   - **Risk Management Philosophy**: Always prioritize avoiding pink boob poop over catching any other type
     - Better to miss a golden poop than accidentally catch a boob poop
   - **Animation Reading**: Watch for the baby's enhanced 4-phase shooting animation to predict incoming projectiles
     - Anticipation phase (scale down) gives early warning
     - Burst phase (scale up + crying) indicates imminent poop launch
     - Use the shake and recovery phases to position for the next shot
   - **High-Value Target Acquisition**: Actively pursue golden poop when the path is clear
     - The 50-point bonus becomes increasingly common (5% increase per 100 points), making late-game golden poop very frequent
     - Golden poop creates spectacular visual rewards with multiple particle bursts
   - **Speed Adaptation Strategy**: As the game accelerates, shift focus from catching everything to selective, high-value catches
     - Survival becomes more important than score maximization in later stages
   - **Platform-Specific Tips**:
     - **Desktop**: Use quick, precise arrow key taps rather than holding keys for better control
     - **Mobile**: Use smooth drag movements rather than rapid tapping for more accurate positioning
     - **Cross-Platform**: Learn to read the enhanced particle effects - they provide crucial feedback about your performance and poop types
