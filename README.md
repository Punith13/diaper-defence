# Diaper Defense üçºüí©

A hilarious arcade-style mini-game built for Reddit using Three.js and Devvit. Control a diaper to catch falling poop projectiles while avoiding the dreaded "boob poop" that ends your game instantly!

## What is Diaper Defense?

Diaper Defense is a production-ready, fast-paced arcade game built specifically for Reddit using Three.js and the Devvit platform. Players control a white diaper at the bottom of the screen to catch various types of falling poop projectiles shot by an expressive baby at the top. The baby oscillates smoothly across the screen using sine wave motion and displays contextual emotions - crying when shooting regular or dangerous poop, and happy when shooting valuable golden poop.

This absurdly entertaining game combines strategic risk-reward gameplay with Reddit's signature humor, creating an addictive experience perfect for quick gaming sessions within Reddit posts. The game features a complete gameplay loop with precise AABB collision detection, progressive difficulty scaling that increases baby shooting speed every 15 seconds, and rich visual effects including particle systems and multi-phase animations.

Players must make split-second strategic decisions about which poop to catch while avoiding the pink "boob poop" that instantly ends the game. The innovative miss system adds depth - missing regular/golden poop counts against you, but missing boob poop is actually beneficial and resets your consecutive miss counter. With its mobile-first responsive design, cross-platform input handling, and seamless Reddit integration, Diaper Defense delivers a uniquely entertaining experience that perfectly captures the platform's playful spirit.

     - Your reliable source of points - safe to catch
     - Falls at base speed (200 units/second) with ¬±25 variation for unpredictability
     - Creates sparkle effects and plays satisfying "plop" sound
     - Features rotation animation while falling for visual appeal
   - **üü° Golden Poop (Fancy)**: 50 points each, 25% base rate (increases with score)

     - Creates spectacular particle bursts and special sound effects
     - Triggers enhanced catch animations with scale-up and spin effects
   - **ü©∑ Pink Poop (Boob)**: INSTANT GAME OVER if caught, 15% spawn rate
     - **Catching it = Game Over**: Touching this poop immediately ends your game with dramatic effects
     - **Missing it = Good**: Letting boob poop fall actually helps by resetting consecutive misses!
     - Falls with same physics but creates ominous particle effects when shot
     - Features fade-out animation when caught before triggering game over
     - Strategic decision: sometimes it's better to let it fall than risk catching it

#### 4. **Understanding Game Mechanics**
   - **Baby Behavior**: The baby oscillates smoothly across the top using sine wave motion (150 unit amplitude)
     - Shoots poop at random intervals (starting at 2000ms base, with 0.5-1.5x randomization)
     - Shooting rate increases by 10% every 15 seconds (minimum 500ms interval for maximum challenge)
     - Features dramatic 4-phase shooting animation: anticipation ‚Üí burst ‚Üí intense shake with rotation ‚Üí recovery
     - **Dynamic Expressions**: Baby shows different emotions based on poop type being shot
       - üò¢ Crying face for regular and boob poop (default state)
       - üòä Happy face when shooting golden fancy poop
       - Expression changes before shooting, then returns to crying after 1 second
     - Poop is shot from slightly below baby position (30 units down) for realistic trajectory
   - **Progressive Difficulty**: Every 15 seconds, shooting speed increases by 10%
     - Creates natural difficulty curve from casual to intense
     - Minimum 500ms interval ensures maximum challenge is still playable
   - **Smart Miss System**: You can miss up to 2 consecutive poop projectiles
     - **Important**: Missing pink boob poop is actually GOOD and resets your consecutive miss counter!
     - Only brown and golden poop count as actual misses
     - Total misses and consecutive misses are tracked separately
     - Catching any poop resets your consecutive miss counter
     - HUD shows: "Misses: X (Y consecutive)" with real-time updates
   - **Collision Detection**: Precise AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) system ensures fair gameplay

#### 5. **Game Over Scenarios**
   - **Instant Death**: Catch a pink boob poop (immediate game over with dramatic particle effects)
   - **Miss Limit**: Miss 2 brown or golden poop projectiles in a row (pink poop misses don't count!)
   - **Recovery**: Click "Play Again" to restart immediately with full audio-visual experience
   - **Final Score**: Your score is displayed prominently on the game over screen with semi-transparent brown background

#### 6. **Pro Tips for High Scores**
   - **Stay Centered**: Position yourself under the baby's oscillation path for optimal coverage
   - **Master the Miss System**: Remember that missing pink boob poop is actually beneficial!
     - Let boob poop fall to reset your consecutive miss counter
     - Only worry about catching brown and golden poop
   - **Risk Management**: Always avoid pink poop, even if it means missing golden ones nearby
   - **Read Baby Expressions**: Watch for the happy face - it means valuable golden poop is coming!
   - **Use Animation Cues**: The baby's 4-phase shooting sequence helps predict trajectories
   - **Adapt to Speed**: Focus on survival over score maximization as difficulty increases
   - **Platform Optimization**:
     - Desktop: Use quick, precise key taps for better control and rapid repositioning
     - Mobile: Use smooth drag movements for accurate positioning without overshooting
