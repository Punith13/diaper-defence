# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The High Score Tracker is a feature enhancement for the Diaper Defense game that enables persistent storage and display of player high scores across all game sessions. The system leverages Devvit's Redis integration to store scores globally and provides an intuitive interface for players to view leaderboards directly from the game over screen.

## Glossary

- **High_Score_System**: The complete high score tracking and display functionality
- **Score_Entry**: A record containing player score, timestamp, and Reddit user information
- **Leaderboard_Display**: The UI component showing ranked high scores to players
- **Score_Storage**: Redis-based persistent storage system for high score data
- **Game_Over_Screen**: The existing UI screen displayed when gameplay ends
- **Reddit_User**: Authenticated player using the Devvit platform integration

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want my high scores to be saved automatically when I finish a game, so that my achievements are preserved across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a game session ends, THE High_Score_System SHALL automatically save the final score to Score_Storage
2. WHEN saving a score, THE High_Score_System SHALL include the Reddit_User identity and timestamp
3. WHEN a score qualifies for the leaderboard, THE High_Score_System SHALL store the Score_Entry in Redis
4. THE High_Score_System SHALL validate score data before storage to prevent invalid entries
5. IF the storage operation fails, THEN THE High_Score_System SHALL handle the error gracefully without affecting gameplay

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a "High Scores" button on the game over screen, so that I can easily access the leaderboard after completing a game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN the High Scores button is clicked, THE High_Score_System SHALL fetch and display the current leaderboard
4. THE High_Score_System SHALL provide visual feedback during leaderboard loading
5. THE High_Score_System SHALL handle network failures with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to view a leaderboard showing the top scores from all players, so that I can see how my performance compares to others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the leaderboard is requested, THE High_Score_System SHALL retrieve the top 10 scores from Score_Storage
2. THE Leaderboard_Display SHALL show rank, score, player name, and date for each entry
3. THE Leaderboard_Display SHALL highlight the current player's best score if it appears in the top 10
4. THE Leaderboard_Display SHALL format scores with proper number formatting and separators
5. THE Leaderboard_Display SHALL include a "Close" button to return to the Game_Over_Screen

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the high score system to work seamlessly with Reddit's authentication, so that my scores are properly attributed to my Reddit account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE High_Score_System SHALL use Devvit's authentication to identify the Reddit_User automatically
2. WHEN storing scores, THE High_Score_System SHALL associate each Score_Entry with the authenticated Reddit_User
3. THE High_Score_System SHALL display Reddit usernames in the leaderboard while respecting privacy settings
4. THE High_Score_System SHALL handle anonymous or unauthenticated users gracefully
5. THE High_Score_System SHALL prevent score manipulation by validating user identity server-side

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the high score system to be responsive and work well on mobile devices, so that I can view leaderboards regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Leaderboard_Display SHALL be optimized for mobile screen sizes and touch interaction
2. THE High_Score_System SHALL load leaderboard data efficiently to minimize wait times
3. THE Leaderboard_Display SHALL use responsive design principles for various screen orientations
4. THE High_Score_System SHALL provide appropriate touch targets for mobile users
5. THE High_Score_System SHALL maintain consistent visual styling with the existing game interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the high score system to integrate cleanly with the existing Devvit architecture, so that it doesn't disrupt current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE High_Score_System SHALL use the existing server API structure with /api/ endpoints
2. THE High_Score_System SHALL leverage the current Redis integration without requiring additional setup
3. THE High_Score_System SHALL follow the established client-server communication patterns
